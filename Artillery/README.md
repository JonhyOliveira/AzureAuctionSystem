## Intro
These scripts were adapted from those given to us by the professors.

### Scripts to initialize the system

create-users.yml -> creates 100 users (if starting with a fresh database, delete file "users.data")
create-auctions.yml -> creates 300 auctions with a variable number of bids and questions

### Script to test the system

baseworkload.yml -> workload with 2 scenarios: (1) user that checks her auctions and responds to questions;
(2) user searches for auctions and bids on some of them.
